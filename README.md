This app allows the user to filter restaurant options based on neighborhoods and/or type of food. The default home page contains a map with all restaurants mapped as well a summary of all restaurant options at the bottom. If "View Details" is clicked on a restaurant, the user will navigate to detailed information for that restuarant including hours of operation, address, and customer reviews. The "Home" link can be pressed to return to the homepage.

## Accessibility
The application utilizes features for accessibility such as aria-labels, high-contrast formatting, scope and focus features.
